        <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
        <p><strong>The <u>HyperText Markup Language</u> or HTML</strong> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.</p>
        <p><strong>HTML describes the structure of a Web page.</strong> <em>HTML</em> consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content. HTML elements label pieces of content such as <small>"this is a heading"</small>, "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc. By using <s>HTML</s> we can write subscript and superscript. Ex: H<sub>2</sub>O and X<sup>2</sup>+1 </p>
